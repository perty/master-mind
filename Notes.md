# Notes on developing

I ran into some issues when developing the exercise that perhaps
can hit others.

## elm-test-rs

Since I use `elm-tooling`, I got `elm-test-rs` as an option for testing. However, I got weird errors when trying to run it. Turns out that after 
running `npx elm-test` (sic) and answering yes to installing it, things 
started to work.
