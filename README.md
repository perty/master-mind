# Master Mind

The game of Master Mind, a coding exercise.

## Game rules

A two player game. One selects four pegs, each in one of six colors. The opponent is to guess which they are.

A guess is marked with black and white hints. A black hint means that a guess is right color and place, while
a white hint is for correct color but wrong place.

Given the information from the hints, the opponent can make another guess and eventually do a completely correct 
guess or run out of possible guesses, 10. In the latter case, the opponent has lost.
